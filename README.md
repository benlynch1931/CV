I am a committed, hardworking and persevering individual; currently studying Software Development and a recent graduate of Makers Academy. I endeavour to take criticism positively, and use it to better my performance and skills. I enjoy learning and stepping out of my comfort zone. I frequently delve into solve interesting and complex problems, and cannot wait to do it on a daily basis.

I have had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember; First beginning to code back in 2012 - nothing fancy, just a basic static HTML page with lots of pictures of cars... - and have grown to build bigger and more complex projects. Projects I have worked on and am working on include a Knitting Chart web application and a website for a community choir. The Knitting Chart is designed to help knitters plot the colour pattern they're working on and has the features to save/load charts and mirror colours across their charts to save time. It has been built to the specification of a client and will hopefully grow into something even bigger.
 
Helping people undoubtedly makes me feel amazing about myself and bring joy to my life, and every piece of code I write has an end goal of helping others, whether it creates an easier and more pleasant user experience, or gives them access to a process that wasn't originally available. To me, coding isn't just a task or job, it's a passion that has more to it than meets the eye. Hence, I am keen to kickstart my career as a Software Developer and begin working on projects that impact the lives of people.

## Skills

_I have linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ZiUAQcDAD8MbCSNxeQTbas6QAriSpD3/view?usp=sharing) to the feedback I received after completing a code review. It provides a detailed summary of how I did during the review._


#### Leadership

The role of Bar Supervisor required me to lead by example and show how things should be managed and executed to a team of 5 people. Through my time, I feel I showed great leadership skills and lead my fellow colleagues in the right direction while serving customers. On busy nights, I ensured that everyone understood their roles and tasks for the evening. They were all very receptive and seemed to clearly understand any work I delegated to them.


#### Communication

I pride myself on being a good communicator. As a bartender, I have dealt with complicated orders and difficult customers which both require a high level of communication. This has been vital in creating a healthy and hospitable environment for everyone.

As a member a variety of musical ensembles, I built communication skills not just by talking, but by listening and being aware of others. It is important that you stay in tune and in time with one another to create a performance worth watching. This is reflected as a bartender as it is customary for you as the server to listen to the customer to make them feel welcome. 


#### Ability to Adapt

In numerous situations, I have had to adapt my approach towards customers if they have not responded as I originally assumed. For instance, if an individual is heavily under the influence of alcohol or drugs, I have adapted to talk in a slower, more calming tone to reassure them I am not hostile. Likewise, if A customer is abrupt or unhappy, you must adapt to become apologetic or empathetic depending on the problem.


#### Problem Solver

Whilst studying Physics A Level I excelled at problem-solving and the questioning of theories. Completing questions always left me with a sense of achievement as I obtained the answer and correctly identified the method needed to solve the problem.

#### Team-Driven

I have always thrived when working in a team. I consistently strive to contribute wherever possible, whether it being able to bounce ideas off one another or being motivated to keep up with teammates, as evidenced by my participation in clubs and my employment as a bartender in busy pubs. The bar is a fast-paced environment where any lack of effort is noticeable and will always negatively impact anybody else who is working.

#### Committed

Throughout my life I have been a long-standing member of various clubs and ensembles, including the Somerset County Youth Choirs, and Cheddar Valley Music Club. I have been a part of the Cheddar Valley Brass Bands since I was 7 years old, rehearsing every Wednesday during term-time, with at least one performance per term.
