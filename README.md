## Ben Lynch

I am a committed, hardworking and persevering individual; currently studying Software Development and a recent graduate of Makers Academy. I endeavour to take criticism positively, and use it to better my performance and skills. I enjoy learning and stepping out of my comfort zone.

Projects I have worked on and am working on include a Knitting Chart web application and a website for a community choir. 

I frequently delve into solve interesting and complex problems, and cannot wait to do it on a daily basis.

I have had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember; First beginnig to code back in 2012 - nothing fancy, just a boring static HTML page with lots of pictures of cars... - and have grown to build bigger and more complex projects. 
 
Helping people undoubtedly makes me feel amazing about myself and bring joy to my life, and every piece of code I write has an end goal of helping others, whether it creates an easier and more pleasant user experience, or gives them access to a process that wasn't originally available. To me, coding isn't just a task or job, it's a passion that has more to it than meets the eye. Hence, I am keen to kickstart my career as a Software Developer and begin working on projects that impact the lives of people.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (September '20 - December '20)

- See [here](#Education)

**TransVault (ISV Company), Clevedon** ('16)  
_School Work Experience_

- I spent a week rotating around the departments, whilst experiencing an office environment. I particularly enjoyed the Product Management and Marketing Departments. During this week, I began creating a prototype of a Restaurant Management software product. I then pitched this to colleagues at TransVault as if it were a real life meeting.

**Crown Inn, Churchill** (September '20 - present)  
_Bartender_

- I secured a job here when I worked on resetting the till from The Crown Inn, Axbridge and worked on implementing all the information needed for this new pub. It was a long haul, but taught me the importance of commitment and time management when working towards a deadline.

**The Crown Inn, Axbridge** (April '19 - July '20)  
_Bar Supervisor (Feb '20 - July '20)_

_Bartender (April '19 - Jan '20)_

- As an additional role to being a bartender or supervisor, I was the person who sorted out the till and any issues we ran into or any menu updates that needed putting in.
- I took the initiative to be the one to set up the new Wi-Fi router for the pub, which took longer than expected due to miscommunication with the various internet provider companies, so it was a chance for me to actively problem solve in the real world.

## Skills


#### Leadership

Being a Bar Supervisor required me to lead via example and show how things should be managed and executed to a team of 5 people. Through my time, I feel I showed great leadership skills and lead my fellow colleagues in the right direction while serving customers. On busy nights, I ensured that everyone understood their roles and tasks for the evening. They were all very receptive and seemed to clearly understand any work I delegated to them.


#### Communication

Working in pubs and restaurants, it is always important to maintain and enhance the rapport you build with customers. For example, knowing the regular drinkers by name and knowing what they drink so you can anticipate their needs. In top of this, it creates a healthy and hospitable environment which people are more than to dine in.

Being involved in a variety of musical ensembles, you build communication skills not by talking, but by listening and being aware of others. It is important that you stay in tune and in time with one another to create a performance worth watching. This is reflected as a bartender as it is customary for you as the server to listen to the customer to make them feel welcome. 


#### Ability to Adapt

In numerous situations, I have had to re-evaluate my tone and approach towards customers as they have not responded as I originally assumed. For instance, if an individual is heavily under the influence of alcohol or drugs, I have adapted to talk in a slower, more calming tone to ensure them I am not hostile. Likewise, if A customer is abrupt or unhappy, you must adapt to become apologetic or empathetic depending on the problem.


#### Problem Solver

Whilst studying Physics A Level I excelled at problem-solving and the questioning of theories. Completing questions always left me with a sense of achievement as I obtained the answer and correctly identified the method needed to solve the problem.

#### Team-Driven

I have always thrived when working in a team. I consistently strive to contribute wherever possible, whether it being able to bounce ideas off one another or being motivated to keep up with teammates, As evidenced by my participation in clubs and my employment as a bartender in busy pubs. The bar is a fast-paced environment where any lack of effort is noticeable and will always negatively impact anybody else who is working.

#### Committed

Through my life I have been a long-standing member of various clubs and ensembles, including the Somerset County Youth Choirs, and Cheddar Valley Music Club. I have been apart of the Cheddar Valley Brass Bands since I was 7 years old, rehearsing every Wednesday during term-time, with at least one performance per term.
