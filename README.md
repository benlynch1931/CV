## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Leadership

Being a Bar Supervisor required me to lead via example and show how things should be managed and executed to a team of 5 people. Through my time, I feel I showed great leadership skills and lead my fellow colleagues in the right direction while serving customers. On busy nights, I ensured that everyone understood their roles and tasks for the evening. They were all very receptive and seemed to clearly understand any work I delegated to them.


#### Communication

Working in pubs and restaurants, it is always important to maintain and enhance the rapport you build with customers. For example, knowing the regular drinkers by name and knowing what they drink so you can anticipate their needs. In top of this, it creates a healthy and hospitable environment which people are more than to dine in.

Being involved in a variety of musical ensembles, you build communication skills not by talking, but by listening and being aware of others. It is important that you stay in tune and in time with one another to create a performance worth watching. This is reflected as a bartender as it is customary for you as the server to listen to the customer to make them feel welcome. Not only this, but having a singing background has taught me guarantee I have excellent diction and projection, so when speaking to customers, they understand me and arenâ€™t left confused.


#### Ability to Adapt

In numerous situations, I have had to re-evaluate my tone and approach towards customers as they have not responded as I originally assumed. For instance, if an individual is heavily under the influence of alcohol or drugs, I have adapted to talk in a slower, more calming tone to ensure them I am not hostile. Likewise, if A customer is abrupt or unhappy, you must adapt to become apologetic or empathetic depending on the problem.


#### Problem Solver

Whilst studying Physics A Level I excelled at problem-solving and the questioning of theories. Completing questions always left me with a sense of achievement as I obtained the answer and correctly identified the method needed to solve the problem.

#### Team-Driven

I have always thrived when working in a team. I consistently strive to contribute wherever possible, whether it being able to bounce ideas off one another or being motivated to keep up with teammates, As evidenced by my participation in clubs and my employment as a bartender in busy pubs. The bar is a fast-paced environment where any lack of effort is noticeable and will always negatively impact anybody else who is working.

#### Committed

Through my life I have been a long-standing member of various clubs and ensembles, including the Somerset County Youth Choirs, and Cheddar Valley Music Club. I have been apart of the Cheddar Valley Brass Bands since I was 7 years old, rehearsing every Wednesday during term-time, with at least one performance per term.
